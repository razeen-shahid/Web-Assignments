                    <p>Almost every technology related talk I attended would begin by going over the importance and impact that the technological progress of the previous century had made. From the Lacida Cipher machine to Alexander Bell’s invention of the telephone to Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service, each presented their own breakthroughs and implications. However, I never fully appreciated how powerful the impact of computers could be until a fellow internee at the Pakistan Red Crescent used his learnings as a Computer Science undergraduate student to bring some improvement to the organization’s surprisingly disorganized blood donation management processes. Volunteers would manually enter records and match details of each donor to the bags which resulted in loss of and inaccuracy of records. We automated the entire process using JavaScript and Python, enabling a significant reduction in resources and mistakes. This was the first time that I had truly understood the impact that technology could bring about.</p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>In an effort to understand and explore the world of computers and the languages in which they process and communicate, I decided to take up Computer Science as an A-Level subject. This has provided me with a good introduction to the field. It has given me a renewed view on Artificial Intelligence systems and has allowed me to develop an interest in how neural networks work. If-then nesting is a simple yet powerful logic that I have learnt to leverage to allow computers to make complex decisions based on facts and variables previously fed to the system. Taking A-Level Mathematics, along with Physics and Economics has helped train my mind to be an analytical one that can take abstract concepts and problems and represent them in common languages that can be understood and solved.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite having an avid interest in machine learning and neural network design, my primary interest is in cybersecurity. Reading Edward and Matthew Amoroso’s ‘From CIA to APT: An Introduction to Cybersecurity’ has enlightened me about the complexities involved breaking down a computer or network system’s infrastructure just to be able to break into it, and how criminal use of such understanding has the potential to bring great harm to us and all parts of our environments that are integrated with technology. I was able to explore this more through my internship at Roshan Packages – chief competitor to the nation’s largest Paper and Board manufacturer. My supervisors in the IT Department explained to me how simple breaches of their systems or infrastructure could bring their production, most of which was automated, monitored and adjusted via a centralized computer network, to a grinding halt. Lester Evans, through his book ‘Cybersecurity’ informed me about how Artificial Intelligence was becoming an asset for cybercriminals. Through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks, researchers have been able to demonstrate that it is very much possible to bypass current defense mechanisms we have against malware to infect systems that are otherwise deemed secure.</p>
                    <br>   
                    <p>Furthermore, my experience as a WordPress Developer at School of Strategic Studies Lahore has allowed showcasing my creative and elegant developing skills. I created and validated test routines and schedules to guarantee that test cases are modelled after external interfaces and that they cover all browser and device types, directed and performed website updates regularly, and also I identified problems uncovered by customer feedback and testing, and corrected or referred them to appropriate personnel for correction. I was able to improve load speed on mobile, from 15 to 6 seconds, by applying recommendations by Google Lighthouse. I occasionally also analysed network security and current infrastructure (using Wireshark) to assess areas in need of improvement and implemented solutions; reviewed and assessed architecture design, implementation, testing and deployment needs to identify project requirements and costs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lastly, as an IT Consultant at Daily Minute Mirror- an emerging daily English newspaper- I occasionally analyse network security and current infrastructure (using Wireshark) to assess areas in need of improvement and implement solutions. I also review and assess the architectural design, implementation, testing, and deployment needs to identify project requirements and costs. I assisted in the initial UI/UX design process of the company website using tools such as Adobe XD and Figma, and then partially programmed the front-end (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript) to build actual web-based prototypes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I feel that problem-solving and analytical skills are something that I have both developed and found great use for even outside my academic environment. Participating in debates has helped me appreciate the idea of solving problems algorithmically by dividing it into steps and resolving each independently. Being selected to the organizing committee of a national-level high-school science Olympiad has also reinforced the importance of bringing together people and components that are harmonious with one-another to be able to deliver a project or a solution effectively and fully.</p>
